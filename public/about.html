<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>My name is Ellie. My approach to learning is characterized by a voracious but fleeting interest. I am deeply curious and enthusiastic about exploring new areas of 
    knowledge, although retaining information for long periods can be a challenge. My educational journey has included English literature, graphic design, advanced Excel, 
    finance, and accountancy. </p>

<p>Currently, I am delving into web development through Udemy, which is exciting and new territory for me. This is my first code project, and I am eager to see how far I can 
    go with it.</p>
